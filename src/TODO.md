```
# Task 1

I would like to create a C++ class to represent a collection of projects that can be assigned to employees. Each employee can be assigned 0 or more projects, and each project can be assigned to one or more employees. projects can be assigned to and removed from an employee, the projects collection must not be empty. Based on the current classes in the 'src' folder, please recommend a design including any modifications to the existing classes.

# Task 2

Show how to create tests for the new classes and public methods.

# Task 3

I will also need to modify the employee test class to test the new functionality. Please provide a sample test case for the new functionality.

# Task 4

I need to ensure that the tests are included in my CMakeLists.txt. Please show an updated CMakeLists.txt file that includes the new tests.
